    <h2>React & frameworks/libraries advantages over Vanilla JS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Frameworks in general - consistent module usage and folder layout
        structure so new projects look less alien
      </li>
      {/*   Reusability argument taken from    
      Momin, A. (2020) React V/S vanilla JS - when to use what?, DEV Community.

      <li>
        React encourages the use of reusable components to reduce code
        repetition & easier maintenance
      </li>
      <li>
        React offers far better performance - far less page changes due to the
        Virtual DOM
      </li>
      <li>React is supported by the giant company Meta</li>
      <li>
        Frontend frameworks such as React are very popular and trendy vs having
        to re-invent the wheel and do all that work in vanilla JS
      </li>
      <li>
        Like all popular frameworks React has a large supportive community with
        a focus on the frontend whilst pure JS communities are more splintered
        and could focused on all manner of niche or backend/Node tasks.
      </li>
      <li>
        JSX makes handling dynamic data easier than just using Html with bits of
        script tags coming in and out of it or writing a lot of document writes
        in an external file. JSX reminds me of template engines like Blade from
        Laravel or Twig in Symfony
      </li>
      <li>
        Angular has an amazing CLI than can construct so many things for you
      </li>
      <li>
        Svelte is very easy to learn & will often involve having to write far
        less code than using vanilla JS
      </li>
    </ul>
